## **_Opening Thoughts!_** ##

Being an engineer is not enough to make an impact on your company or your team, you are working with different types of people every day and that requires constant development on an 
interpersonal and technical level. 

**Where Do You Start**

There are many tools that you're going to experiment with and lots of team dynamics that you're going to want to explore. Be bold and try it all, there's definitely going to be growing pains, but it's worth it.

**Why Team Culture Is Important**

Lack of a healthy team culture is one of the biggest impediments to the overall productivity of the team. Change my mind.

I first stumbled upon the ideology and practice of a "blameless culture" while researching the job function of DevOps and how DevOps came to be as I wanted to be involved in every aspect of the company, 
and I thought this was the best way to do it. Based on my research, I found that DevOps started out as a philosophy, something that is agnostic to the job responsibilities 
that someone under that role assumes. Which is brilliant in all honesty, from that point onward I decided that I wanted to become a DevOps Engineer. 
Here are some various lessons I learned while on the road to being an overall disciplined engineer and a genuine team player.

1. Being blameless requires constant reflection on how you view yourself and others
2. You may be able to perform every job function separately but that does not mean you can do it all alone
3. Stay humble, it's a lot easier to work your way out of an impostor syndrome episode if you aren't 
constantly pretending to be the only one who can solve the problems you're working on
4. One step at a time, knowing how you could hypothetically solve all the problems is savage on your mental health
5. Your communication needs constant work, you are interacting with technical and non-technical stakeholders at every stage
6. Guard your mental balance
7. Whose fault it is simply doesn't matter - learn, adapt and get the work done

**Why Being a Team Player & Being a Disciplined Engineer Are Two Peas In a Pod**

If you're a disciplined engineer, you are aware of the limitations that coincide with working solo. 

Working alone on an entire project, you miss out on a rapid feedback loop, you could be creating redundant work, and you most certainly could be working on the wrong things for longer than you want to.
Suddenly, you're a metal head!

If you are struggling to accept help, ask for help from your managers or senior peers on how to combat that solo instinct. It's not always easy to work people, because suddenly, there is a lot more to consider, 
and you find yourself with more work. But this extra work means what you're going to help the team produce will be that much closer to meeting the company goals. I struggled with this firsthand and still do from time to time
because I convince myself that I can do it faster if I work alone, but that is a fallacy because this ultimately means you are cutting corners. So what you ultimately achieve is wasted time for yourself, the team and the company.

**What's Next**

I might write about pair programming next. This has done wonders in an almost magical way for me as a professional and a disciplined engineer.
