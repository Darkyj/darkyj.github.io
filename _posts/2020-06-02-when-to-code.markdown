I have yet to read [The Art of Readable Code][book-ref] but I mean to as it appears to be a great resource for 
new and old Software Engineers alike.

I started my career as a Quality Assurance intern with no software development experience. Like most people, 
I didn't know where to start. Where do you begin when Software is so intangible? 

If there is one extraordinarily clear thing, it's that everyone who wants to learn immediately wants to 
build everything after building their first "Hello World" program.

When the opportunity arises, you want to build a tool to automate some process or another. You naively work 
through the problem you are trying to solve in your mind, how you can get it done quickly and how you don't foresee any issues. You start working on it, and then you realize it didn't take the 30 minutes that you estimated initially, an hour passes, and where are you in the rabbit hole that you've dug yourself into? Soon you find that you've accepted more than enough requests to find yourself wanting to work longer than your mental health can take. What does all this mean?

It means that you need to learn how to leverage existing technologies and rethink how you're approaching 
problem-solving in general. You don't need to build a brand new tool every time for every problem that you are 
trying to solve. It's a hard pill to swallow because there is still so much for you to learn, but doing enough 
research can yield many more fruits than beating your head against the metaphorical wall for hours on end until 
you're about ready to pass out at your desk. 

**If there are a few things that come to mind when I consider building a new tool, it's probably the following:**
1. What problem are we trying to solve?
2. What is the overall goal that we are trying to achieve?
3. Does a tool already exist that fits the use-case?
4. How expensive is it to build the tool?
    - Your time is valuable.
    - The time of those around you is expensive.
    - The tool that is produced will need to be maintained.

The list can probably on indefinitely, but these come to mind first whenever my team and I get together to solve a 
problem. Leverage and guard your time.

**How do you know if you're wasting your time?**

1. If there is already a tool that exists, that solves your use-case
2. If any cost regardless of optimization efforts associated with purchasing a software tool is considered too expensive, 
strictly from a financial perspective
3. If you don't know enough about the problem that you are trying to solve, how can you solve a problem that 
you don't understand?
4. If you and your team aren't stating your assumptions

**Why You Should State Your Assumptions And How It Saves Time**

"When you explain how you've reached your decision, team members will have an opportunity to call out new 
facts or ideas that can help you make a better decision. Alternatively, if team members agree with your reasoning, 
they will walk away with a deeper appreciation for your choice. They will respect your ability to assess a situation, 
break it down into facts and logical conclusions, and lead indecisive action. Additionally, listing your assumptions 
allows you to logically validate your decision: is your decision sound and based on the reality of your 
current situation?" - [State your Assumptions][assumptions]

**In Closing**

As you are more protective over your time, and effectively cutting out the time waster side quests, 
you'll find yourself learning at a much more productive and effective rate.  
That being said, there's nothing wrong with venturing off into the wilderness and trying to 
build all the things. But speaking from personal experience, it gets frustrating, and work becomes 
extremely un-fun as you find yourself missing tons of deadlines that you set if you promise to code something 
up for every problem you find yourself trying to solve.
