At first glance, Jekyll is just another standard library, but it feels like so much more than that. 

For example, I for one hate spending too much time on front-end related work. I choose to invest my time learning and
experiencing each part of the technology stack with a focus on the backend. 

Jekyll and GitHub, made it so incredibly easy to get started. There wasn't really a learning curve to get around, and 
I've always wanted a blog post but never wanted to spend time pushing pixels to make everything "just right". 

What I don't need to worry about:
1. I don't need to concern myself over server setup and then protecting that resource
2. Creating tons of CSS
3. SSL!!!!
4. Lack of community driven support
5. Lack of great documentation

The list could probably go on forever, I'm beyond ecstatic and can't wait to continue using this to document what I'm 
learning every day. 

I'll be diving into [Jekyll variables][jekyll-vars] after this to make things a lot more structured and 
prettier, but the defaults are honestly pretty on point, so it's not going to be a 
huge stretch to make things even better.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

If you're looking for an extensive and truly in depth tutorial, please take a look at 
[Programming Historian's tutorial][programminghistorian-tut]. 
This wonderful human goes into all the little tid-bits you may find yourself wondering. I 
didn't need it exactly but if I didn't know where to begin, I'd start there.
